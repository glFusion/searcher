# Searcher plugin for glFusion
## Overvies
This plugin is an attempt to provide an improved search function for glFusion
using one or more index tables to allow fulltext-type searching without
requiring a fulltext index.

Much of the internal mechanics is yet TBD. Currently the article content type
is supported, and requires manually running "makeindex.php" from the plugin
directory.
